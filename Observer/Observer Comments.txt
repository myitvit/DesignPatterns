Observer Pattern

In a Publish/Subsribe relationships, Button is publisher and Event Handlers are subsribers

Observer Consequences:
1) Observer may not recieve notifications
2) We may get repeated notifications
3) We may recieve notifications very quickly
4) Strong references may stop Garbage Collector from disposing objects
